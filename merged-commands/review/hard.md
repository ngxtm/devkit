# /review:hard — Deep Code Review

> **MISSION**: Comprehensive code and architecture review.

<scope>$ARGUMENTS</scope>

---

## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS PHASE 1)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):
1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md  
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md  
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md  

**⛔ Do not run Phase 1 until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files; they override any conflicting instructions in this file.

---

## 🔀 TIERED EXECUTION

| Tier | When | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| **TIER 1** | runSubagent EXISTS | Invoke sub-agent (MANDATORY) |
| **TIER 2** | Tool MISSING | EMBODY agent file (FALLBACK) |

---

## 📁 PLAN COMPLIANCE CHECK

```
IF ./reports/plans/PLAN-{scope}.md exists:
  - Verify code implements plan specification
  - Check for unauthorized deviations
  - Ensure all phases reflected in code
```

---

## ⛔ INCREMENTAL EXECUTION (MANDATORY)

One phase at a time, each phase independent: Phase 1 → then Phase 2 → … in one reply. No batching (load only what each phase needs). **Within each phase:** when doing a part, output it in format so user sees what’s happening (announce before doing).
