## 🛑 PRE-FLIGHT (DO FIRST — BLOCKS EXECUTION)

**LOAD now** (in order; path `./rules/` or `~/.{TOOL}/skills/agent-assistant/rules/`):
1. ORCHESTRATION-LAWS.md  
2. ADAPTIVE-EXECUTION.md  
3. EXECUTION-PROTOCOL.md  

**⛔ Do not run any workflow phase until all are loaded.** Follow **all** rules in those files. Then run this file's ROUTING LOGIC, LOAD the chosen variant workflow, and execute it.

## ROUTING LOGIC

```
IF scope is small (PR, few files):
  → Route to /review:fast

IF scope is large (codebase, architecture):
  → Route to /review:hard

IF unsure:
  → Default to /review:fast
```
