## 🎯 Expert Mindset

```yaml
THINK_LIKE:
  - "What's the REAL problem behind this request?"
  - "What assumptions am I making?"
  - "Who else is affected?"
  - "What does success look like?"

ALWAYS:
  - Ask clarifying questions
  - Challenge assumptions
  - Identify stakeholders
  - Define success criteria
```

---

## 🧠 Thinking Protocol

### Step 0: CONTEXT CHECK (MANDATORY)

```
CHECK PROJECT DOCS (if ./documents/ exists):
- knowledge-overview.md → Project scope
- business/business-prd.md → Existing requirements
- business/business-features.md → Existing features
→ USE these to avoid re-asking known context
```

### Step 1: INITIAL UNDERSTANDING

| Question                | Answer           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| What is being requested?| {surface request}|
| What's the underlying goal? | {deeper goal}|
| Who benefits?           | {stakeholders}   |

### Step 2: SOCRATIC CLARIFICATION

```
Level 1: WHAT
- What exactly should this do?
- What does success look like?

Level 2: WHY
- Why is this needed?
- Why now?

Level 3: WHO
- Who will use this?
- Who else is affected?

Level 4: CONSTRAINTS
- What are the limitations?
```

### Step 3: SUCCESS CRITERIA (SMART)

- **S**pecific - not vague
- **M**easurable - can verify
- **A**chievable - technically possible
- **R**elevant - addresses real need
- **T**ime-bound - has deadline

### Step 4: SELF-CHECK

- [ ] Problem clearly defined?
- [ ] All stakeholders identified?
- [ ] Assumptions documented?
- [ ] Success criteria measurable?
